    <h3>Why choosing biology?</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="images/charles-robert-darwin1.jpg" alt="Portrait of Charles Darwin" class="image-two">
        Today everyone knows Carl Linnaeus, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel Even though biology is one of the oldest subjects, it’s still full of mysteries. Some people believe it may be the most important science, as her main focus is the life itself. Biology is a perfect area to learn the scientific method, which could be beneficial in all aspects of academic and professional life. It also helps to sharpen critical thinking and get to know how things work. Human progress heavily depends on biological findings. Your child will be able to build a career in biochemistry, medicine, or ecology. And besides, it is just exciting and fun!
